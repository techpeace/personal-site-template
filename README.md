# middleman-zurb-template

This is a template for the excellent [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) static site generator that incorporates several foundational components and reasonable defaults for building out a blog. As with all Middleman templates, using [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) and [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/) is recommended.

## Features

* [middleman-blog](https://github.com/middleman/middleman-blog)
* [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
* [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome)
* [FancyBox](http://fancybox.net/)
* [respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond)
* [jQuery 1.9.0](http://jquery.com/)
* Many elements and defaults from [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
* A warning overlay presented to older browsers
* [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/)
* A sensible starter layout for a blog. You will most likely want to make numerous changes to the styling - I didn't make any assumptions about the design. Don't judge it on its looks, this isn't a blog theme, it is meant to be a foundation to build on.

## Installation

Clone into `~/.middleman` (you'll have to create it if it doesn't exist). You can then use it with the `--template` flag on `middleman init`.

1. `git clone git://github.com/mattolson/middleman-zurb-template.git ~/.middleman/zurb-foundation`
2. `middleman init my_new_project --template=zurb-foundation`
